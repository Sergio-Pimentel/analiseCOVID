In this notebook, I present my first data analysis project, exploring COVID-19 data in Brazil. I start by integrating and cleaning multiple datasets—cases, deaths, geographic information—and proceed with exploratory analysis and visualizations to identify trends, discrepancies, and insights. My analysis includes comparisons at city, state, and regional levels, highlighting cumulative and daily case trends, mortality rates, and regional differences. Visualizations such as scatter plots, pie charts, and maps illustrate findings clearly and effectively.

Key topics covered:

* Data integration from multiple sources (CSV and SQLite databases)
* Handling and imputing missing data effectively
* Calculation and analysis of cumulative and daily COVID-19 cases and deaths
* Exploration of discrepancies between reported cases and deaths at city versus state levels
* Creation of geographical visualizations using GeoPandas and Matplotlib
* Visualization of temporal trends with scatter plots and connected line charts
* Calculation and interpretation of mortality and lethality metrics
* Analysis of moving averages to identify trends in mortality rates
